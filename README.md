# mrtryxhelpR

The mrtryxhelpR package aids in implementing the MR-TRYX framework
in situations where outcome variables are derived from individual-level data, 
as compared to summary statistics hosted on the MR-Base platform. The package works to 
extend the functionalities already provided by the tryx package (https://github.com/explodecomputer/tryx).
