Description: MR Tryx (TReasure Your eXposures) provides a comprehensive framework to identify and adjust for pleiotropic variants in a summary-level data context. This has been implemented in the tryx package. However, as the tryx package currently stands, it is complicated to include associations not currently held in the MR-Base database (e.g associations derived from individual-level data). This package simplifies the process of importing and including exposure and outcome variables not currently held in the MR-Base platform so they can be used within an MR-Tryx framework.
